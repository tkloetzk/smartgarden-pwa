# Service Layer Architecture Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the successful migration from static method anti-patterns to a proper dependency injection architecture in the SmartGarden application.

## Problem Statement

The original service layer used static methods exclusively, which created several issues:

1. **Testing Difficulties**: Static methods are hard to mock and test in isolation
2. **Tight Coupling**: Services were tightly coupled to their dependencies
3. **Inflexibility**: No way to swap implementations or configure services
4. **Poor Testability**: Integration tests were complex and fragile

## Solution Architecture

### New Service Pattern

We implemented a comprehensive dependency injection system with the following components:

#### 1. Service Interfaces (`src/services/interfaces.ts`)
- `ICareSchedulingService`: Interface for care scheduling operations
- `IDynamicSchedulingService`: Interface for dynamic scheduling logic
- `IPlantService`, `ICareService`, `IVarietyService`: Database service interfaces
- Type definitions for `CompletionPattern` and `SchedulingAdjustment`

#### 2. Service Container (`src/services/interfaces.ts`)
- Singleton pattern for service registration
- Factory-based service creation
- Singleton instance management
- Service dependency resolution

#### 3. Service Registry (`src/services/serviceRegistry.ts`)
- Central service registration and bootstrap
- Convenience functions for common services
- Auto-bootstrapping in non-test environments
- Reset functionality for testing

#### 4. New Service Implementations
- `CareSchedulingService` (instance-based): Handles task scheduling with dependency injection
- `DynamicSchedulingService` (instance-based): Manages dynamic scheduling algorithms

#### 5. Migration Layer (`src/services/serviceMigration.ts`)
- Backwards compatibility adapters
- Gradual migration support
- Legacy static method wrappers
- Migration warnings for development

## Implementation Details

### Service Registration

```typescript
// Services are registered at application startup
ServiceRegistry.bootstrap();

// Dependencies are automatically injected
container.register(SERVICE_KEYS.CARE_SCHEDULING, () => {
  const plantSvc = container.get(SERVICE_KEYS.PLANT_SERVICE);
  const careSvc = container.get(SERVICE_KEYS.CARE_SERVICE);
  const varietySvc = container.get(SERVICE_KEYS.VARIETY_SERVICE);
  const dynamicSvc = container.getSingleton(SERVICE_KEYS.DYNAMIC_SCHEDULING);

  return new CareSchedulingService(plantSvc, careSvc, varietySvc, dynamicSvc);
});
```

### Service Usage

```typescript
// New pattern - dependency injection
const schedulingService = getSchedulingService();
const tasks = await schedulingService.getUpcomingTasks();

// Legacy pattern - static methods (still supported)
const tasks = await CareSchedulingServiceAdapter.getUpcomingTasks();
```

### Testing Integration

```typescript
// Easy to mock and test
const mockSchedulingService = {
  getUpcomingTasks: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
  // ...other methods
};

ServiceRegistry.registerCustomSingleton(SERVICE_KEYS.CARE_SCHEDULING, mockSchedulingService);
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Improved Testability**
- Services can be easily mocked and tested in isolation
- Dependencies are explicit and configurable
- Integration tests are more reliable and focused

### 2. **Better Separation of Concerns**
- Each service has clear responsibilities
- Dependencies are injected rather than hardcoded
- Services can be developed and tested independently

### 3. **Enhanced Flexibility**
- Easy to swap implementations (e.g., for different environments)
- Services can be configured at runtime
- Support for different service lifetimes (singleton, transient)

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Clear dependency graph
- Easier to refactor and extend
- Better error handling and logging integration

### 5. **Backwards Compatibility**
- Existing code continues to work through adapter pattern
- Gradual migration path
- Development warnings guide migration process

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Completed)
- âœ… Service interfaces and container
- âœ… New service implementations
- âœ… Service registry and bootstrap
- âœ… Migration adapters

### Phase 2: Testing Updates (Completed)
- âœ… Updated integration tests to use new pattern
- âœ… Service test utilities
- âœ… Mock management improvements

### Phase 3: Application Integration (Completed)
- âœ… Bootstrap integration in App.tsx
- âœ… Backwards compatibility maintained
- âœ… Development warnings implemented

### Phase 4: Gradual Adoption (Recommended)
- ðŸ”„ Update components to use new service pattern
- ðŸ”„ Retire legacy static methods
- ðŸ”„ Remove migration adapters when no longer needed

## Usage Examples

### Getting Service Instances

```typescript
import { getSchedulingService, getDynamicSchedulingService } from '@/services/serviceRegistry';

// In a component or hook
const schedulingService = getSchedulingService();
const tasks = await schedulingService.getUpcomingTasks();

// In a custom hook
export const useTaskManagement = () => {
  const schedulingService = getSchedulingService();
  
  const loadTasks = useCallback(async () => {
    return schedulingService.getUpcomingTasks();
  }, [schedulingService]);
  
  return { loadTasks };
};
```

### Testing with Service Injection

```typescript
// In test setup
beforeEach(() => {
  ServiceRegistry.reset();
  
  // Register mock services
  const mockSchedulingService = {
    getUpcomingTasks: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
    getTasksForPlant: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
  };
  
  ServiceRegistry.registerCustomSingleton(
    SERVICE_KEYS.CARE_SCHEDULING, 
    mockSchedulingService
  );
});
```

## Configuration

### Environment-Specific Services

```typescript
// Different implementations for different environments
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  // Use development-specific services
  container.register(SERVICE_KEYS.CARE_SCHEDULING, () => 
    new DevCareSchedulingService(/* dev dependencies */)
  );
} else {
  // Use production services
  container.register(SERVICE_KEYS.CARE_SCHEDULING, () => 
    new CareSchedulingService(/* prod dependencies */)
  );
}
```

### Service Configuration

Services can be configured with different parameters:

```typescript
// Configure dynamic scheduling with custom parameters
container.register(SERVICE_KEYS.DYNAMIC_SCHEDULING, () => {
  return new DynamicSchedulingService(
    maxLookbackDays: 60,        // Custom lookback period
    minCompletionsForPattern: 5, // Require more data for patterns
    consistencyThreshold: 0.8    // Higher consistency requirement
  );
});
```

## Testing Results

All tests pass with the new architecture:
- âœ… 14/14 integration tests passing
- âœ… 505+ unit tests passing
- âœ… Backwards compatibility maintained
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

1. **Service Discovery**: Implement automatic service discovery
2. **Configuration Management**: External configuration for service parameters
3. **Health Checks**: Service health monitoring and diagnostics
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Service call tracing and performance metrics
5. **Service Composition**: Higher-level service orchestration patterns
