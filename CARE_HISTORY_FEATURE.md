# Care History Filter Pills Feature

## âœ… Feature Completed

The care history component now dynamically shows only the filter pills/tabs that have actual data.

### What Changed

**Before:**
- Always showed all activity type filters (Water, Fertilize, Observe, Harvest, Transplant, etc.)
- Many pills would be shown even when no data exists for those activity types

**After:**
- Only shows "All Activities" (always present) + activity types that have actual data
- Dynamically updates based on the care history content
- Automatically resets filter if current selection becomes unavailable

### Implementation Details

#### File Modified
- `src/components/plant/CareHistory.tsx`

#### Key Changes

1. **Dynamic Filter Generation:**
```typescript
// Get unique activity types that actually exist in the care history
const existingActivityTypes = [...new Set(careHistory.map(activity => activity.type))];

// Filter to only show activity types that have data, plus "All Activities"
const activityTypeFilters = [
  { value: "all", label: "All Activities", icon: "ðŸ“‹" },
  ...allActivityTypeFilters.filter(filter => 
    existingActivityTypes.includes(filter.value)
  )
];
```

2. **Auto-Reset Invalid Filters:**
```typescript
// Reset filter to "all" if current filter is not available in the data
useEffect(() => {
  if (filter !== "all" && !existingActivityTypes.includes(filter)) {
    setFilter("all");
  }
}, [filter, existingActivityTypes]);
```

3. **Expanded Activity Type Support:**
Added support for more activity types including Photos, Notes, Pruning, and Repotting.

### Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests (`src/__tests__/components/CareHistory.test.tsx`) covering:

- âœ… Shows only activity types that have data
- âœ… Shows only "All Activities" when no care history exists  
- âœ… Filters activities correctly when filter button is clicked
- âœ… Shows correct activity count in header
- âœ… Handles single activity type correctly

All tests pass (5/5).

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Plant with Water + Fertilize activities**
- Pills shown: "All Activities", "Watering", "Fertilizing"
- Pills hidden: "Observations", "Harvest", "Transplant", etc.

**Scenario 2: Plant with only Watering activities**
- Pills shown: "All Activities", "Watering"
- Pills hidden: All other activity types

**Scenario 3: Plant with no care history**
- Shows empty state message
- No filter pills displayed

**Scenario 4: Plant with diverse activities (Water, Photo, Note)**
- Pills shown: "All Activities", "Watering", "Photos", "Notes"
- Pills hidden: Other unused activity types

### Benefits

1. **Cleaner UI:** No clutter from unused filter options
2. **Better UX:** Users only see relevant filters for their data
3. **Dynamic:** Automatically adapts as new activity types are added
4. **Robust:** Handles edge cases like filter reset when data changes
5. **Extensible:** Easy to add new activity types to the supported list

### Technical Notes

- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing care history data
- Preserves existing filtering and "show more/less" functionality
- No breaking changes to component API
